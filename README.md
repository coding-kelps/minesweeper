# ⚠️ Why does this repository is archived?
I've started this project in order to learn Rust.
However at the time I've began this project I found myself taken by my student group's work and a skill gap to catch up at the beginning of my internship,
those two weren't about Rust. I've so decided to put aside this project.

# minesweeper
minesweeper is a lightweight rust version of the famous minesweeper game. It purpose it to be used as an environment for reinforcement learning.
